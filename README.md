# Skin-Cancer-Detection
Using convolutional neural network to assist with the detection of skin cancers using microscopic images of the skin.

Dataset used was obtained from this competition website - https://challenge.isic-archive.com/landing/2017 

## Goal 
Skin cancers are a very common health condition plaguing a good number of people and detection usually tends to prove cumbersome and can be a challenging for healthcare professionals. The goal of this work is towards creating a model that will be useful in assisting clinicians in making informed decisions.

The dataset is actually quite small despite being large in memory size, this greatly impacted performance. Perhaps, if the model were to be used for industrial purposes, more data can be sought and included.
